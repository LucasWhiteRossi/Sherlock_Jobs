## Objective - (The great Why?)

The main objective is to to bring relevant information for:
- Candidates: to adapt their curriculum, select the best fit to vacancies, fill skill gaps, and analyze salary offers.
- Education companies: to adapt their content to what is sought in the market.

## MVP - How it is done

### First Draft:
I used Selenium to scrape Catho's dynamically generated web page.
Catho is the first target of this MVP. It is an influent job posting site in Brazil.

### From the job description scraped the aim is to analyze:

- salaries distributions;
- top skills searched;
- check the frequency of buzz words related to the field;


### Future steps:
- cluster job descriptions;
- conduce a regression model for the salary based on job description;

### Other ideas for new projects:  
- Use recent job descriptions to automate improvements in curriculum writing.
